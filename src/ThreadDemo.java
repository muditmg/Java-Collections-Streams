        //ExecutorService: ExecutorService is part of the java.util.concurrent package and is a higher-level thread management API.
        //uses Thread Pooling: Reuses a fixed number of threads, which avoids the overhead of creating new threads for every task.
        ExecutorService executorService= Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);  //Creates a fixed thread pool with Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2). This means at most 2 threads will execute tasks concurrently.
        for(int i=0; i<5; i++){

    }


//Using Runnable over extending Thread in Java is generally considered a better practice.
//Java classes can inherit from only one class (single inheritance).
// If you extend the Thread class, you lose the ability to extend another class because youâ€™ve already used up the single inheritance.
//With Runnable, you implement an interface, so your class can still extend another class.
// With Runnable, the same task can be executed by multiple threads. You can create multiple Thread instances with the same Runnable object.
